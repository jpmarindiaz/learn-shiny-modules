# Learn shiny modules

Some scripts I use to learn shiny modules.
They are simply notes from watching the video at:
https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/understanding-shiny-modules/

If you follow the examples at 1-modules-walkthrough.R you would be ready to go with shiny modules.

When I have some time I will make the proper Rmd files.
